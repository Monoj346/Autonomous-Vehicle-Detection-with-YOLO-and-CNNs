This project trains a YOLO-based object detection model on a vehicle dataset. It preprocesses images (416×416), normalizes them, and pads labels to a fixed shape (20,5). A CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and BatchNorm is trained using Adam optimizer & MSE loss. To prevent OOM errors, batch size is reduced, and dropout is added. The trained model is saved as "yolo_trained_model.h5" for inference. 🚀


*due to GPU restrictions, only 500 images have been used in the training of the model which you can easily change.. 
Wishing good luck! 😁
